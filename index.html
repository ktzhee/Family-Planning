  <h1>Alaga at Tiwala</h1>
  <p>Alaga at Tiwala is a website that aims to increase awareness and stress the value of appropriate 
    family planning. We believe that denying a person access to proper family planning will only lead 
    to complications in family stability and well-being. Such complications include poor financial 
    stability, mental health problems, and death or disability related to complications in childbirth 
    and pregnancy. All these factors could result in an unstable home environment and could develop 
    into domestic violence. The page aims to educate visitors on family planning options, child rights, 
    and legal support available in the Philippines. Its goal is to provide support for victims and to 
    promote healthier families and well-being in the community. </p>

  <h1>What is family planning?</h1>
  <p>Family planning is a way to reach your desired number of children and control the spacing of 
    pregnancies with the use of contraceptives. Access to family planning directly supports access to 
    proper sexual and reproductive health care. It fosters economic opportunity, education, and gender 
    equality, promotes health, and plays a crucial role in achieving broader development goals. </p>

  <h1>Understanding Child Welfare and Support</h1>
  <p>Having a well-planned, stable, and nurtured family is essential to a child’s development. Unplanned 
    families, poverty, or lack of normal parental care can result in numerous issues and negative 
    effects on a child’s well-being. In the situation where the physical, social, and psychological 
    health of a child begins to become overly concerning, child welfare becomes extremely important. </p>

  <h1>Why does it matter?</h1>
  <ol>
    <li>Proper family planning helps prevent complications that affect family stability, safeguard financial security, promote mental health, and reduce risks related to childbirth and pregnancy.</li>
    <li>Supporting family planning promotes healthier families and communities by reducing the chances of domestic violence and ensuring child rights and legal protections.</li>
    <li>Addressing family planning and child welfare is crucial for creating a safe, stable, and nurturing environment essential for the well-being and development of children.</li>
