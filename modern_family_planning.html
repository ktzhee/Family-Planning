  <h1>A random statistic</h1>
  <p>Did you know? Nearly 1 in 2 pregnancies in the Philippines are
    unplanned, highlighting the crucial need for accessible family 
    planning resources to promote healthier families and communities. </p>

  <h1>Importance of family planning</h1>
  <ul>
    <h3>
        Protects Health and Well-being
    </h3>
    <li>Family planning allows parents to prepare physically, emotionally, and financially for each 
        child. It reduces health risks for mothers and babies, and helps families thrive 
        together in a safer, more stable home.</li>

    <h3>Promotes Economic Stability</h3>
    <li>Planning for the right family size ensures resources—like food, education, and 
        healthcare—are distributed responsibly. Families can better manage expenses and work 
        towards improved opportunities for all members.</li>
  </ul>

  <h1>Modern Family Planning Methods</h1>
  <ul>
    <h3>
        Barrier Methods
    </h3>
    <li>These physically block sperm from reaching the egg. Examples include male and female condoms, 
        diaphragms, and cervical caps. They are affordable, protect against sexually transmitted 
        infections, and are used only during sexual activity.</li>

    <h3>Hormonal Methods</h3>
    <li>These use hormones to prevent ovulation or thicken cervical mucus. Common types are birth 
        control pills, patches, injections, vaginal rings, and implants placed under the skin. They 
        require regular use or medical administration and offer high effectiveness.</li>
    
    <h3>Intrauterine Devices (IUDs)</h3>
    <li>Small T-shaped devices are inserted into the uterus by a healthcare provider. There are 
        hormonal IUDs that release progestin and non-hormonal (copper) IUDs. IUDs prevent fertilization 
        and can last from 3 to 10 years, providing long-term, reversible contraception.</li>
  </ul>
    
  <h1>A random statistic</h1>
  <p>Investing in family planning can reduce poverty rates by as much as
    30% in communities with accessible resources.
    <br>Children born into planned, healthy families are more likely to stay in school, enjoy better 
    nutrition, and grow up in loving, stable homes.</p>
